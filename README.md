# K-Nearest-Neighbors-with-MNIST-Dataset
As the title says, KNN implementation from the MNIST dataset. 
- Gets 96-98% accuracy with K between 1 and 5. I guess it's decent.
- it can probably be easily modified to work with any other data set
- BUUUUT it's pretty slow. so... yea, that's something to work on, I guess.
